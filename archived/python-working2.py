#  How can I use built-in functions?
#  How can I find out what they do?
#  What kind of errors can occur in programs?


#  Use comments to add documentation to programs.


#  A FUNCTION may take zero or more arguments
#  A function must always use parentheses



# Commonly-used built-in functions include max, min, 
#  and round.




# Use the built-in function help to get help for a function.


# Python reports syntax errors
# when it canâ€™t understand the source of a program.



# Python reports a runtime error 
# when something goes wrong while a program is executing.

#  How can I use software that other people have written?
#


# Most of the power of a programming language is in its libraries.
# A library is a collection of files (called modules) 
# that contains functions for use by other programs.
# May also contain data values 
# PyPI is the Python Package Index


# A program must import a library module before using it.
# Refer to things from the module as module_name.thing_name
# Using math, one of the modules in the standard library:


# Use help to learn about the contents of a library module.


# Create an alias for a library module when importing 
# it to shorten programs.

# How can I read tabular data?
#

# Import the Pandas library.
# Pandas is a widely-used Python library 
# for statistics, particularly on tabular data.

# Use Pandas to load a simple CSV data set.
# Get some basic information about a Pandas DataFrame.
# Use the Pandas library to do statistics on tabular data.



# Use index_col to specify that a column's 
# values should be used as row headings


# Use DataFrame.info to find out more about a dataframe


# Use DataFrame.T to transpose a dataframe


# Use DataFrame.describe to get summary statistics 
# about data.


# Writing Data with to_csv


# # # # #
# Selecting Values in a Pandas DataFrame
# # # # # 

# What makes Pandas so attractive is the powerful interface 
# to access individual records of the table, proper handling 
# of missing values, and relational-databases operations 
# between DataFrames.


# Use DataFrame.iloc[..., ...] to select values by their (entry) position
# Can specify location by numerical index 



# Use DataFrame.loc[..., ...] to select values by their (entry) label.



# Use : on its own to mean all columns or all rows.



# # That's it for today!  On to the challenge questions and survey
