# Data Analysis with Python (2): Figures
# Practice questions

\

### Question 1: Scatter plot

We can make a scatter plot very similarly to a line plot with `ax.scatter()` instead of `ax.plot()`. Try recreating the life expectancy line plots with scatter plots, instead. 

\

## Question 2: Histograms

Plot histograms of `gdp_per_day` for 4 different countries in the `gapminder.csv` data set. You can do this in one or multiple panels.

\

## Question 3: Plots from the gallery
Take a look at the some of [the plot types in matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html) and [the Seaborn Gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html). Using the `gapminder` data, recreate some of these plot types in matplotlib and/or Seaborn.
