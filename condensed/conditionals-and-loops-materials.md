# Introduction to Python (2) 
# Conditionals and Loops Questions


## Question 1: Boolean expressions
Does the following code evaluate as `True` or `False`?

```python
n1 = 45
n2 = -23
n3 = 0
s1 = 'hello'
s2 = 'goodbye'

not (n2 < n3 and s1 == s2 or n1 >= n3)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- `n2 < n3` -> `True`
- `s1 == s2` -> `False`
- `n1 >= n3` -> `True`
- `n2 < n3` and `s1 == s2` -> `False`, because the first part is not `True`
- Now we can evaluate `n2 < n3 and s1 == s2 or n1 >= n3`. Because `n2 < n3 and s1 == s2` is `False` and `n1 >= n3 is True`, this whole expression is `True`, as only of the two needs to be `True`
- The `not` around the parentheses causes the final value to be `False`

</details>


## Question 2: Boolean types
What happens when you compare different data types with `==`? What about `>`, `<`, `<=`, or `>=`?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

`==` will work between different data types. For the most part, it will return `False` for these comparisons. However `1 == 1.0` and similar statements will return `True`. 

Inequalities when comparing strings will compare the length of the strings, though typically using `len()` explicitely is preferred for clarity. Floats and ints can be compared straightforwardly. However other data types should not be compared with inequalities. Most often you will receive an error. In rare cases, there may be a computed value, but the returned value may not have much meaning. 

</details>


## Question 3: if-else

Create a variable called `num` and assign it the value of some number. Create an if-else statement that checks to see if `num` negative is negative or not.

If `num` is negative, multiply `num` by `-1` to make it positive, then print the new value.

Otherwise, multiply the number by itself (square it), and print this new value. 

Try your code with different values for `num`.

<details>

Make sure to try having `num` be both negative and non-negative to check if your code works.

<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
num = 13

if num < 0:
    print(num*-1)

else:
    print(num*num)

```

</details>


## Question 4: if-elif-else

Consider this code:

```python
if 4 > 5:
    print('A')
elif 4 <= 5:
    print('B')
elif 4 < 5:
    print('C')
```

Which of the following would be printed if you were to run this code? Why did you pick this answer?

1. A
2. B
3. C
4. B and C

<details>

<summary>Solution</summary>

The correct answer is **2. B**. `4 > 5` is `False`, so `elif 4 <= 5` is evaluated, and it is `True`. Even though `4 < 5` is `True`, this `elif` statement is not evaluated. Once a `True` statement is found, any `elif` statement below will be ignored. 

</details>


## Question 5: Conditionals

Write code that will prints the square root of `x` if x is larger than 20 and `0` if x is less than `0`.

**Bonus**: Print an error message if x is a string or a boolean. 

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
x = 22

if type(x) == str:
   print('x needs to be a string.')

elif x >20:
   print(x**1/2)

elif x < 0:
   print(0)
```
</details>


## Question 6: Squaring

Create a blank list as a variable.

Using a for loop, append that list with `.append()` with the square of all integers from 5 to 15. 

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Making the blank lists gives us a place to save the squares.

`range(5, 16)` allows iterated through integers starting at 5 up to, but not including, 16. 

```python
squares = list()

for i in range(5, 16):

    squares.append(i**2)

```
</details>

## Question 7: Looping over a string

Given the following loop:

```python
word = 'oxygen'
for letter in word:
    print(letter)

```
How many times is the body of the loop executed?

- 3 times
- 4 times
- 5 times
- 6 times

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The loop is executed 6 times: one for every character in the string `'oxygen'`. `letter` is assigned to a new character each time though the loop.

</details>


## Question 8: `for` loops

Iterate over all integers from 0 to 1000 and print all multiples of 41 (numbers that can be divided by 41 with no remainder). How many multiples are there?

Hint: We can use `%` to get remainders.

For instance, `5 % 2` gives us 1.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

`range(1001)` lets you iterate over the correct integers. `n % 41 == 0` will check to see if the remainder when dividing by 41 is 0. `i += 1` will increase the value of `i` every time we find a multiple. 

```python
i = 0 # counts the number of multiples

for n in range(1001):

   if n % 41 == 0: #if the remainder is 0

      print(n)
      i += 1

print('number of multiples:', i)
```

</details>


## Question 9: More loops
Below are four lists: `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`.

Using a single for loop, subtract the values of x1 and x2 at each index, and take the square of the difference. Do the same for `y1` and `y2`. Add the two squares together. Store all 4 squares in a list in the same order.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Using enumerate on one list can make sure we grab items at the same index in the other lists.

```python
vals = list()

for i, x_1 in enumerate(x1):

   x_2 = x2[i]
   y_1 = y1[i]
   y_2 = y2[i]

   val = (x_1 - x_2)**2 + (y_1 - y_2)**2
   vals.append(val)

```

</details>


## Question 10: Comprehensions

Using a list comprehension and range() to make a list containing integers 10 - 1000.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>


```python
integers = [ i for i in range(10, 1001) ]0o
```

</details>

# Challenge questions

## 1) Conditionals and loops


Below is a tongue twister:

Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
Whereâ€™s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?

Turn the tongue twister into a string. Feel free to remove line breaks to make it easier.

Using a for loop and conditionals, count how many times the letter "P" is used, either lower case or upper case.

##  2) More conditionals 

Create a list called `my_list` with the numbers 0 through 3 in it. Create a variable called `x` with some value.

Create a series of conditionals that check to see if the value in `x` is in `my_list`. 

If this is the case, print out different text depending on what index the item is at in the list.

0. "From zero to hero"
1. "One is the loneliest number."
2. "Two's company."
3. "Three's a crowd."


### 3) Nested for loops

On the next page is a nested dictionary structure called `environment_data` containing temperature, humidity, and pressure values for different months in 2021 and 2022. Copy and paste it into a Python cell.

For each year, use for loops to store the months with temperature above 20 degrees and humidity between 50 and 60 in their own lists.



```python
environment_data = {
    '2021': {
        'January': {'temperature': 12.3, 'humidity': 40.2, 'pressure': 1012},
        'February': {'temperature': 11.1, 'humidity': 42.7, 'pressure': 1008},
        'March': {'temperature': 13.2, 'humidity': 44.5, 'pressure': 1006},
        'April': {'temperature': 15.8, 'humidity': 50.1, 'pressure': 1010},
        'May': {'temperature': 18.5, 'humidity': 52.3, 'pressure': 1005},
        'June': {'temperature': 21.2, 'humidity': 55.8, 'pressure': 1000},
        'July': {'temperature': 23.8, 'humidity': 57.2, 'pressure': 1001},
        'August': {'temperature': 25.6, 'humidity': 60.1, 'pressure': 1005},
        'September': {'temperature': 22.5, 'humidity': 58.2, 'pressure': 1009},
        'October': {'temperature': 19.4, 'humidity': 51.7, 'pressure': 1011},
        'November': {'temperature': 16.3, 'humidity': 47.2, 'pressure': 1010},
        'December': {'temperature': 13.4, 'humidity': 43.8, 'pressure': 1008}
    },
    '2022': {
        'January': {'temperature': 9.8, 'humidity': 38.1, 'pressure': 1015},
        'February': {'temperature': 10.5, 'humidity': 43.2, 'pressure': 1010},
        'March': {'temperature': 12.9, 'humidity': 47.0, 'pressure': 1004},
        'April': {'temperature': 16.0, 'humidity': 50.6, 'pressure': 1011},
        'May': {'temperature': 18.9, 'humidity': 53.5, 'pressure': 1006},
        'June': {'temperature': 21.6, 'humidity': 57.1, 'pressure': 1001},
        'July': {'temperature': 24.2, 'humidity': 59.4, 'pressure': 1002},
        'August': {'temperature': 26.0, 'humidity': 62.3, 'pressure': 1006},
        'September': {'temperature': 22.9, 'humidity': 59.8, 'pressure': 1010},
        'October': {'temperature': 19.8, 'humidity': 54.5, 'pressure': 1012},
        'November': {'temperature': 16.7, 'humidity': 49.1, 'pressure': 1011},
        'December': {'temperature': 13.8, 'humidity': 45.5, 'pressure': 1009}
    }
}
