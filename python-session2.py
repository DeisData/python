#  How can I use software that other people have written?
#
#
# Most of the power of a programming language is in its libraries.
# A library is a collection of files (called modules) 
# that contains functions for use by other programs.
# May also contain data values 
# PyPI is the Python Package Index
#
#
# A program must import a library module before using it.
#



# Refer to things from the module as module_name.thing_name
# Using math, one of the modules in the standard library:
import math

print('pi is', math.pi)
print('cos(pi) is', math.cos(math.pi))


# Use help to learn about the contents of a library module.
help(math)

# Import specific items from a library to shorten program, save memory
from math import cos, pi

print('cos(pi) is', cos(pi))


# Create an alias for a library module when importing 
# it to shorten programs.
import math as m

print('cos(pi) is', m.cos(m.pi))

# Reading in Data with Pandas #

# How can I read tabular data?
#

# Import the Pandas library.
# Pandas is a widely-used Python library 
# for statistics, particularly on tabular data.

# Use Pandas to load a simple CSV data set.
# Get some basic information about a Pandas DataFrame.
# Use the Pandas library to do statistics on tabular data.

data = pd.read_csv('gapminder_data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv')
print(data)


# Use index_col to specify that a column's 
# values should be used as row headings

data = pd.read_csv('gapminder_data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv', index_col = 'country')
print(data)


# Use DataFrame.info to find out more about a dataframe
data.info()

# Use DataFrame.T to transpose a dataframe
data.T

# Use DataFrame.describe to get summary statistics 
# about data.
print(data.describe())

# You can also writing Data with to_csv


# # # # #
# Selecting Values in a Pandas DataFrame
# # # # # 

# What makes Pandas so attractive is the powerful interface 
# to access individual records of the table, proper handling 
# of missing values, and relational-databases operations 
# between DataFrames.

df = pd.read_csv('gapminder_data/gapminder_gdp_europe.csv', index_col='country')


# Use DataFrame.iloc[..., ...] to select values by their (entry) position
# Can specify location by numerical index 
print(df.iloc[0,0])

# Use DataFrame.loc[..., ...] to select values by their (entry) label.
print(df.loc["Serbia","gdpPercap_2007"])



# Use : on its own to mean all columns or all rows.
print(df.loc[:,"gdpPercap_2007"])



# and apply functions to subsets of data, for example, here
# we find the maximum value of gdp in 2007 from European countries
# (it is Norway)
print(df.loc[:,"gdpPercap_2007"].max())



# # That's it for today!  On to the challenge questions and survey
